# ESDB
Code for ESDB: Expand The Shrinking Decision Boundary via One-to-Many Information Matching for Continual Learning with Small Memory. IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 2024

Note that τ in the paper is changed to 1-τ in this implementation (The value of τ=0.75 in the paper is equivalent to τ=0.25 in this implementation, where as τ increases, the decision boundary is pushed further towards new classes.).

Run: python ESDB_main.py
